/**
 * MCPs tab — Expo Router Stack.
 *
 * The tab opens on the grid dashboard (``index``). Deeper screens push
 * onto this stack:
 *   - ``install``: secret-entry form for a marketplace server the user
 *     chose to install (params: name, version).
 *   - ``[name]``: edit screen for any installed MCP row.
 *
 * The "new custom MCP" form lives inline as the 4th tab on the dashboard,
 * not as a pushed route — so there is no ``new`` screen registered here.
 *
 * Expo Router is layered on react-navigation; the ``<Stack />`` below
 * is the same native stack navigator, so native back gestures and
 * screen transitions work out of the box. The navigator owns every
 * header: the dashboard gets the drawer toggle, sub-screens get a back
 * button + title (set per-screen via setOptions).
