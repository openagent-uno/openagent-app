/**
 * Workflows tab — Expo Router Stack.
 *
 * Opens on the list dashboard (``index``). The visual editor pushes
 * onto this stack as ``[id]``.
 *
 * Mirrors ``mcps/_layout.tsx`` one-to-one — same pattern, same
 * transitions; the navigator owns the headers (the list + run history),
 * while the visual editor screen manages its own full-canvas chrome.
 *
 * Both screens are declared explicitly. Expo Router will still discover
 * ``[id]`` from the file system without this line, but being explicit
 * keeps the route order deterministic and matches ``mcps/_layout.tsx``.
